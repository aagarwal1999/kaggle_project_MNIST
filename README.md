Hello, before you embark on reading this code, you must download the database I used from the website below
The reason for this is because the data-sets are too large to be pushed remotely to github. 

Here is the website URL: https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset 

Make sure you download the matlab files, not the binary files. 

Once that is done, extract the files into a folder called Data. After that, everything should work.
